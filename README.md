The raw data was downloaded from the European Social Survey Round 11 data. I selected the columns necessary for my three research questions and placed them in a seperate dataset (ess11New). The columns were renamed and outliers were removed. I continued to visualize the three hypotheses with ggplot bar graphs. Finally, I applied the statistical analyses.
