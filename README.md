The raw data was downloaded from the European Social Survey Round 11 data. I selected the columns necessary for my three research questions and placed them in a seperate dataset (ess11New). The columns were renamed and outliers were removed. I continued to visualize the three hypotheses with ggplot bar graphs. Finally, I applied the statistical analyses.
 
Gender: 0 = female, 1 - male.
Woman_Protection: a five part likert scale from disagree strongly to agree strongly.
Religion_Level: an eleven part likert scale from not religious at all to very religious. 
Highest_Edu_Level: includes 27 items, with 0 having not completed primary eduction and 800 having completed a doctoral degree.
